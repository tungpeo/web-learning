    <p>This is Jack. He's an <i>odd</i> little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may <i>look</i> happy, but he's a <i>little</i> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jack would really like...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li> Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="https://www.etoys.com/">eToys</a>.
